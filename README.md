# Football Game Simulator

This repository contains a simple text-based football game simulator written in Python. The game allows you to play either a half (4 drives) or a full game (8 drives) against an opponent. You can choose between two difficulty levels: Easy or Hard.

## Gameplay

### Objective
The goal of the game is to outscore your opponent by strategically choosing plays (either passing or running) to gain yards and eventually score touchdowns or field goals.

### Mechanics
- **Drive Structure**: Each drive consists of up to 4 downs to move the ball a total of 75 yards down the field.
- **Play Options**: 
  - **Pass Plays**: Choose from a variety of pass plays like slants, hail mary, etc., each with different potential gains.
  - **Run Plays**: Opt for running plays such as inside run, quarterback sneak, etc., with varying yardage potential.
- **Outcome Determination**: After each play call, the game determines the success based on a success rate. There's also a chance of turnovers (interceptions or fumbles) which could end your drive.
- **Opponent Score**: After your drive, the opponent may also score based on the game difficulty chosen (Easy or Hard).

### Winning
- The game concludes after all drives are completed.
- The team with the higher score wins. If scores are tied, the game results in a tie.
